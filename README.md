Get your client secret from the Google API console
https://console.developers.google.com/ and save it in secret.json adjacent to
upload.py.

Then run upload.py in a GUI enabled machine, log in via the opened web browser
and it should upload nested_tables.html as a Google doc file to your drive. 
The nested table will only span the first column ignoring the colspan.
